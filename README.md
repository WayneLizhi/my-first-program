my-first-program
this is my first program,I wish I could do this in a long time;I mean that I need to keep it up and stay strong;
It will be my learning memory,I will use two platform,one is github,another one is csdn;
github for coding;
csdn for ideas'share and thinking recording;
over;
if there is anything changed with my imagination,I will refresh this file;
Bye
